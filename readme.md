# Nanograd

This is a barebones autograd implementation in pure rust meant to show how automatic differenetiation works in neural nets. This was modeled after Pytorch's autograd engine.

There is an accompanying blog with this what walks through building it step by step. You can find that [here](evis.dev/posts/nanograd)

This repo also comes with a training loop and sample neural net (that you can customize) to see how the autograd engine works.
